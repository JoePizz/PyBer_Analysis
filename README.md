# PyBer_Analysis
<p>1.**Overview**<p>
<p>The purpose of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees as well as the titles of these employees. Additionally, the analysis also determined which employees are eligible to participate in a mentorship program, and what their title is.<p>

<p>2. **Results**<p>
<p>As you can see by following the link: https://github.com/JoePizz/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Pyber_Analysis.png, Urban rides account for 80.9% of the total rides while suburban accounts for 16.5% and Rural accounts for 2.6%.<p>
<p>Although there are so many more urban rides taken than Rural and Suburban, the Average Fare per ride and the Average Fare per Driver is so much lower as the supply of drivers is much higher. We can also theorize that in the Urban area the rides are a lot shorter than they would be in the Suburban and Rural areas. See the following link which displays the data on this: <https://github.com/JoePizz/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Screen%20Shot%202021-10-25%20at%209.11.09%20AM.png><p>

<p>3. **Three recommendations**<p>
<p>1. The price per mile should be most expensive in Urban, second most expensive in Suburban and least expensive in Rural. This ranking takes into account the total distance travelled per ride as well as the frequency of the rides.<p>
<p>2. Have a surge charge in the Urban areas. During rush hour times drivers will be using much more gas to travel small distances as they will be sitting idle in traffic. A surge charge helps to compensate the driver for the increased cost of gas while they sit in traffic.<p>
<p>3. The competition amongst drivers in the Urban area could be discouraging. Incentivizing these drivers to continue to drive for your company could help to improve retention.<p>
